            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As for our Author, where-ever Learning, Wit and Judgment have flouriſh'd, this Poet has always had an extraordinary Repuration. To mention all his Excellencies and Perfections were a Task too difficult for us, and perhaps for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Criticks alive; ſo very few there are that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly underſtand all of 'em; yet we ſhall venture at ſome of the moſt Remarkable.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And firſt, We may obſerve of his</hi> Words, <hi>that they are generally nicely choſen, extreamly proper and ſignificant; and many of 'em carry ſo much Life and Force in 'em, that they can hardly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in any other Language without great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Original.

                     <hi>We ſhall next take notice of one or two Inſtances of the Shortneſs and Clearneſs of his Narrations; as that which</hi> Tully <hi>mentions.</hi> Funus interim procedit ſequimur, ad Sepulchrum venimus, in ignem poſita eſt, Fletur. <hi>Another may be that in</hi> Phormio.

                     <hi>Another remarkable Beauty of his Stile appears in his Climaxes; where every Word is Emphatical, heightens the Senſe, and adds conſiderably to what went before.

                     <hi>And as we have ſcarce found one Man in the World that equals him in his Characters, ſo we find but very few that cou'd come up to him in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement (we mean his Art and Contrivance) of his</hi> Plots. <hi>We are ſenſible that many have been ſo fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh as to count his Plays a</hi> bare bundle of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues dreſſed up in a neat Stile, <hi>and there all his Excellency to conſiſt, or at leaſt that they are very ordinary and mean; but ſuch ſenſeleſs Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will ſoon vaniſh upon giving an Account of the Nature and Perfection of 'em.

This we ſee frequently in the chief Actor of the Play, who comes on and goes off, and the Spectaters all the time ſtand ſtaring and wondring at they know not what. Another great Fault common to many of our Plays is, that an Actor's</hi> Name, Quality, <hi>or</hi> Buſineſs <hi>is ſcarce ever known till a good while after his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; which muſt needs make the Audience at a great Loſs, and the Play hard to be underſtood, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing 'em to carry Books with 'em to the</hi> Play houſe, <hi>to know who comes in, and who goes out.</hi>

                     <hi>trangreſs the Rules of</hi> Reaſon <hi>and</hi> Nature, <hi>as well as</hi> Poetry. <hi>Theſe that we mention are not any Mans Arbitary</hi> Rules, <hi>but pure Nature only Methodiz'd: They never hamper a</hi> Poet's <hi>Fancy or clip his Wings, but adorn their Thoughts, and regulate their Flights, ſo as to give 'em a clearer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into</hi> Nature, Probability <hi>and</hi> Decency, <hi>without ſomething of which it is impoſſible to pleaſe. And theſe are no more a</hi> Confinement <hi>to a</hi> Poet's <hi>Fancy, than the true Proportion of Pillars, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity and Uniformity of Windows are to an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect; or the exact Imitation of Nature to a Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: As if there could be half ſo much Beauty in Groteſque and irregular Whims, as in the due Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Rules of Proſpect, Shadows and Proportion.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The laſt Objection is more particular: They ſay,</hi> That the Unities of Action, Time and Place muſt needs take off from the great Variety of the Plot, and a fine Story by this means will be quite murdered. <hi>'Tis true, all</hi> Stories <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever are not fit for a</hi> Dramatick Poem; <hi>yet there may be an excellent</hi> Plot <hi>without crowaing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Intrigues (little depending upon one another) of half a dozen couple, ſuppoſe, in one Play; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurrying over the buſineſs of three Months in three Hours time, or perhaps without skipping from Gardens to Mountains, from thence to Groves, and then to Town in an Act or two: But our prying curious Sparks can't reſt here, but muſt be for peeping into Chambers, Cloſets, and Withdrawing-Rooms, ay, and into Beds too (ſometimes with the Ladies in 'em) and have all things brought openly upon the Stage. tho never ſo improper, and indecent. But this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection may yet better be anſwered by Inſtances; and firſt for the</hi> Unity of Time, <hi>we may mention the Play call'd,</hi> The Adventures of Five
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:180391:11"/> Hours, <hi>the whole</hi> Action <hi>laſting no longer (much leſs a day, the extent allowed for a</hi> Dramatick Poem) <hi>yet this is one of the pleaſanteſt</hi> Stories <hi>that ever appeared upon our Stage, and has as much Variety of</hi> Plots <hi>and</hi> Intrigues, <hi>without any thing being precipitated, improbable or unnatural as to the main</hi> Action; <hi>ſo by this it appears that this Rule is no Spoiler or Murderer of a finer</hi> Story. <hi>Then for the</hi> Unity of Time <hi>and</hi> Action <hi>too,</hi> Ben. Johnſon's Silent Woman <hi>is a remarkable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: an excellent</hi> Comedy <hi>indeed, where the</hi> Action <hi>is perfectly ſingle, and the utmoſt extent of the</hi> Time <hi>exceeds not three Hours and a half, (the ſhorteſt we ever find) yet ſtill the</hi> Plot, Intrigues, <hi>and above all the</hi> Incidents <hi>are very fine; and no ways unnatural. Laſtly, For all three</hi> Unities, <hi>Mr.</hi> Dryden's All for Love <hi>(tho a</hi> Tragedy, <hi>and ſomewhat foreign to our buſineſs) is worthy to be taken notice of, that being perfectly</hi> Regular <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rules of the Stage, the</hi> Scenes <hi>unbroken, the</hi> Incidents <hi>exactly and duly prepared, and all things noble and beautiful, juſt and proportionable. This we reckon one of the beſt</hi> Tragedies <hi>of our Nation. Now can any Man juſtly think that theſe Plays we new mentioned were ever the worſe for that</hi> Regularity <hi>they had; or indeed have we many better in the Nation for</hi> Plot; <hi>or many that have better pleas'd the generality of Perſons that theſe; If ſo, this ſufficiently ſhows the Truth of what we offered; and withal commends our Maſter's great Judgment in this Point: Who in our Opinion (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Excellency of his</hi> Characters) <hi>plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves

                     <hi>Come we next then to our own Vindication, in which we ſhall briefly ſhew the</hi> Reaſons <hi>why we did it, and likewiſe what our Performances have been in this Verſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The main</hi> Reaſons <hi>why we undertook it were theſe. Firſt, For the Excellency and Uſefulneſs of this Author in general: And conſequently for the benefit (as we ſhall ſhew by and by) of moſt ſorts of People, but eſpecially for the Service it may do our</hi> Dramatick Poets. <hi>Next, for the Honour of own</hi> Language, <hi>into which all good Bocks ought to be Tranſlated, ſince</hi> 'tis now become ſo Elegant, Sweet and Copious: <hi>And indeed nothing refines, or gives Foreigners a greater Opinion of any Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage than its number of good Tranſlations; of which the</hi> French <hi>is a great Inſtance. Thirdly, Becauſe moſt of our Neighbours have got it into their</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>particularly the</hi> French, <hi>who have done it with good Succeſs; and we have no reaſon for being outdone by any of our Neighbours, ſince we have a</hi> Language <hi>we dare ſet againſt any in the World. Laſtly, Since the Author is ſo excellent, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took it becauſe no other Perſons wou'd. 'Tis ſtrange that none of our great Wits wou'd undertake it before, but let us Perſons of Obſcurity, take their Works out of their Hands; when we can perceive by our liitle Performances that our</hi> Language <hi>will do it to a very high degree, undoubtedly better than the</hi> French.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The moſt conſiderable Objections that have been</hi>

                     <hi>made againſt our Tranſlation are theſe. Firſt,</hi> What real Uſe or Advantage can this Tranſlation be to the Publick? As for School-Boys and Learners, <hi>Bernard's</hi> and <hi>Hool's</hi> Tranſlations, the great number of Notes, a School-Maſter, or their own Induſtry will well enough teach 'em to conſtrue it. Men of Senſe and Learning, they read it wholly for the Latin ſake; therefore a Tranſlation is of no uſe to them. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> they won't fit our Stage; and conſequently they are impertinent at beſt. <hi>To theſe we anſwer; Firſt, As to</hi> School-Boys <hi>and</hi> Learners! Bernard's <hi>and</hi> Hool's <hi>Tranſlations are very often falſe, moſtly ſo obſolete, flat and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant, that a Man can ſcarce read half a Page without ſleeping; the latter is full of</hi> Latiniſms, <hi>and both are often more obſcure than the Original. The</hi> Notes <hi>ſometimes don't expreſs the Author; Senſe; and often very obſcurely: In ſome things they are too ſhort, in others too long and tedious: And moſt of them have the ſlight of running very nimbly over thoſe Places which they are afraid they ſhou'd ſtick in.</hi> School-Maſters <hi>often want Time, and now then and Judgment and Learning to explain things as they ought; then to leave Boys by themſelves to pick out the Senſe of ſuch a difficult Author as this, is very inconvenient which, beſides the Diſcouragement ſometimes of not being able to do it, will often lead 'em into ſuch Errors and Miſtakes, as perhaps they'll never g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>As for the ſecond part of the Objection,</hi> That Men of Senſe and Learning read it only for the Latin ſake; <hi>This is or ought to be look'd upon as a great Miſtake: Since</hi> Terence <hi>has other and greater Excellencies than his Style, as we have before ſhewn. But however ingenious Perſons muſt needs receive ſome pleaſure in ſeeing ſuch excellent fine Latin now ſpeak tolerable good</hi> Engliſh: <hi>and likewiſe in ſeeing ſomewhat of the Converſation, Humour and Cuſtoms of the old</hi> Greeks <hi>and</hi> Romans <hi>put into a modern Dreſs; and perhaps not quite out of the Faſhion. Beſides, ſince many of theſe do ſometimes upon an occaſion make uſe of</hi> Notes, <hi>'twill be of equal uſe (in that reſpect) to them as to all</hi> Learners. <hi>And that they have often need of ſuch, will appear from the ſeveral difficult places (eſpecially as to the Plot) and ſome obſcure dubious Paſſages in this Author, which the utmoſt Skill in the</hi> Latin <hi>Tongue will not teach to explain; ſince there is as great a neceſſity for the underſtanding of the</hi> Roman <hi>Cuſtoms and Theatres in this Caſe, and of the Art of the Stage, as of the</hi> Latin <hi>Tongue. How extraordinary uſeful a Tranſlation can be in perfectly</hi> clearing an Author, Roſcommon's <hi>Tranſlation of</hi> Horace's Art of Poetry <hi>is an apparent Inſtance; which ſhews the Senſe, Meaning, Deſign, &amp;c. of</hi> Horace <hi>better and eaſier than all the</hi> Paraphraſes <hi>and</hi> Notes <hi>in the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Tho our</hi> Tranſlation <hi>will never fit our Stage, yet it may be of conſiderable uſe to ſome of the</hi>
                     <pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:180391:13"/> Dramatick Poets; <hi>which we had ſome reſpect to when we did it; they will ſerve 'em (as was ſaid before) for</hi> Models; <hi>and tho many of our Poets do very well underſtand the Original, yet 'tis plain that ſome of 'em do not underſtand it over-much. But however, it may not be wholly uſeleſs to thoſe that do, and more proper for their buſineſs, being ready explained to their hands: And upon ſome accounts to be read with leſs trouble than the Original: For that is in many places very-obſcure by reaſon of corrupted Copies, wrong Points, falſe Diviſion of whole</hi> Acts <hi>as well as</hi> Scenes, <hi>and the like: Further, if theſe Plays come to be frequently read by the more ordinary ſort of People, they will by little and little grow more in love with, and more clearly ſee the true Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of theſe Rules, and theſe lively</hi> Imitations of Nature, <hi>which will be the greateſt Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our Poets can have to follow 'em. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the common People by theſe</hi> Plays <hi>may plainly perceive that</hi> Obſcenities, <hi>and</hi> Debaucheries <hi>are no ways neceſſary to make a good</hi> Comedy; <hi>and the Poets themſelves will be the more ready to bluſh when they ſee</hi> Heathens <hi>ſo plainly out-ao us</hi> Chriſtians <hi>in their</hi> Morals; <hi>for their principal Vices in their Plays were chiefly from the Ignorance of the Times, but we have no ſuch pretence. This alone might ha' been a ſufficient reaſon for our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking this Deſign.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But to come now to what we have done; 'tis not to be expected we ſhou'd wholly reach the Air of the Original; that being ſo peculiar, and the Language ſo different; We have imitated our Author as well</hi>
                     <pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:180391:13"/> 
                     <hi>and as nigh as the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Tongue as our ſmall Abilities wou'd permit; each of us joining and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting about every Line, not only for the doing of it better, but alſo for the making of it all of a piece. We followed no one</hi> Latin <hi>Copy by it ſelf, becauſe of the great diſagreements among 'em, but have taken any that ſeem'd trueſt. We lookld over all the</hi> Notes, <hi>ſometimes they wou'd help us a little, and often not; ſome hints we had from the</hi> French, <hi>but not very many; beſides we had conſiderable helps from other Perſons far above our ſelves, for whoſe Care and Pains we ſhall ever acknowledge our Gratitude. A meer</hi> Verbal Tranſlation <hi>is not to be expected, that wou'd ſound ſo horribly, and be more obſcure than the Original; but we have been faithful Obſervers of his Senſe, and even of his Words too, not ſlipping any of conſequence without ſomething to anſwer it; nay further, where two Words ſeem to be much the ſame, and perhaps not intended to be very different by the Author, we were commonly ſo nice as to do them too; ſuch as</hi> Segnitia <hi>and</hi> Socordia, Scire <hi>and</hi> Noſcere, <hi>and the like, which is more exact than moſt, if not all, our modern Verſions. We cou'dn't have kept cloſer (eſpecially in this Author, which ſeveral ingenious Perſons told us,</hi> Is the hardeſt in the World to tranſlate) <hi>without too much treading upon the Authors Heels, and deſtroying our Deſign of giving it an eaſie,</hi> Comick Stile, <hi>moſt agreeable to our preſent Times. If we have been guilty of any Fault of this nature, it ſeems to be that of keeping too cloſe.</hi>

                     <hi>But ſtill to be more particular; we did all we cou'd to prevent any of the Meaning and Grace of the beſt</hi> Words <hi>to be loſt; ſo that we were often forced to ſearch and ſtudy ſome time for thoſe moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and oftentimes to expreſs 'em by two, and ſome times by a</hi> Circumlocution: <hi>Which Madam</hi> Dacier <hi>her ſelf, as accurate as ſhe is accompted, has often neglected; and thereby has wholly loſt the Force and Beauty of many Emphatical Words.</hi> Terence <hi>had ſome words taken in a great many ſeveral Senſes, ſuch as</hi> Contumelia <hi>and</hi> Injuria, Odioſus, Triſtis, <hi>&amp;c. theſe we have been very careful about; but where he plays upon words (tho never ſo prettily) he ought not in ſome places to be imitated at all, becauſe the Fineneſs is more loſt that way, than the other; yet we try'd at ſeveral when they were Natural and tolerable in</hi> Engliſh. <hi>As for his</hi> Alluſions <hi>and the like, many of them perhaps are quite loſt to us. However they are commonly loſt in our Language. On ſuch places (as well as ſome others) we made</hi> Remarks <hi>or</hi> Notes <hi>at the latter end; ſome of which we are obliged to the</hi> French <hi>Lady for; theſe ſerving to ſhew our Author's fine Stroaks, as well as to vindicate our Tranſlation.

                  <p>I <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>blius Terentius</hi> had his Birth at the famous City of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> in the Year of <hi>Rome</hi> 559, Seven Years after the ſecond <hi>Punick</hi> War, and 192 before <hi>Chriſt</hi> His Parentage was Mean no doubt; ſo little known, that his true Name is not remember'd: for that of <hi>Terence</hi> he took from his Patron <hi>Terentius Lucanus,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Senator. As for his Perſon, he was of a middle Stature, very ſlender, and ſomewhat of a tawny Complexion.</p>
                  <p>When he was very young, and not paſt his Childhood, he was made Captive, as 'tis general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppos'd, by the <hi>Numidians,</hi> who ſent him immediately to <hi>Rome;</hi> and there he happened on the fore-mention'd <hi>Terentius Lucanus.</hi> This Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had ſo great an Eſteem for his good Meen and Excellent Parts, that he did only give him a moſt tender and genteel Education, but his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom too; and what is more, when he was very young; a Favour not very uſual in thoſe Days.</p>
                  <p>After this, he more cloſely apply'd himſelf to Learning; and his obſervations and Studies of Men and Manners, ſeem'd to be his chief Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His exact Remarks upon Mens natural Diſpoſitions; and his Genuis, led him wholly to <hi>Dramatick Poetry,</hi> particularly <hi>Comedy;</hi> wherein all the Humours and Paſſions of Men are ſo nicely obſerved and expreſſed; that we can no where
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:180391:16"/> find a truer and more lively Repreſentation of <hi>Humane Nature.</hi> His comely Perſonage, and his accurate Writings, brought him into a great Eſteem, not only with the People in general, but likewiſe with the greateſt and nobleſt of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>us</hi> and <hi>Lelius.</hi> With theſe two inſeparable Friends and Companions, he had gain'd more than ordinary Familiarity; paſſing away many a fair Hour in Pleaſures and Delights, at their Country Houſe at Mount <hi>Alba.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He made himſelf Maſter of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, from which he borrowed much in his Plays; of which we have ſix remaining. When he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd his firſt Play, and brought it to the <hi>Edils;</hi> they wou'd needs have him read it before <hi>Cece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> as the moſt approved Judge. <hi>Cecelius</hi> was then at Supper. <hi>Terence's</hi> Garb, it ſeems, was none of the beſt at that time, therefore he was ſeated in an ordinary by-place, and there ordered to begin. But a few of his fine Verſes ſo well made amends for the Meanneſs of his Habit, that he was immediately deſired to ſit down and take part of what he found at the Table; being placed next to <hi>Cecelius</hi> himſelf. After Supper, he read over the reſt of his Play to <hi>Cecelius's</hi> wonderful Delight. The Name of it, we find not; it cou'd not be the <hi>Andrian,</hi> for that was made two Years after <hi>Cecelius</hi> was dead.</p>
                  <p>In the 28th Year of his Age, he made his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian;</hi> the firſt <hi>Comedy</hi> that we know of, which he took a great part from <hi>Menander</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Poet. The Year following he made his <hi>Hocyra,</hi> or <hi>Mother-in-Law,</hi> which he took chiefly from <hi>Apollodorus</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Poet. This Play was the firſt time unſucceſsful, and is the only one whoſe <hi>Plot</hi> is perfectly <hi>Single.</hi> Two Years after, he
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:180391:16"/> made his <hi>Heautontimorumenos,</hi> or <hi>Self Tormentor,</hi> which he borrowed moſtly from <hi>Menander.</hi> Two Years after that, his <hi>Phormio,</hi> taken chiefly from <hi>Apollodorus's Epidicazomenos.</hi> The ſame Year, he made his <hi>Eunuch;</hi> of which he borrowed a great part from <hi>Menander:</hi> This by many is reckon'd his beſt; however it came off with far greateſt Applauſe. The Year following, in the 34th Year of his Age he made his laſt <hi>Comedy</hi> called <hi>Adelphi,</hi> or the <hi>Brothers,</hi> and that too was moſtly taken from <hi>Menander;</hi> which <hi>Varro,</hi> as to the beginning of it, prefers to the beginning of <hi>Menander</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Comedies</hi> were in great Reputation among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and generally ſucceeded very well; tho <hi>Plautus</hi> had ſometimes better Luck on the Stage. But never a one of his took like the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> for which <hi>Terence</hi> had 8000 Seſterces; a reward (tho not exceeding Sixty Pounds of our Money) greater in thoſe days then ever <hi>Poet</hi> had. Beſides, it was acted twice in one day; the more ſtrange, becauſe Plays than were never made but to be acted two or three times in all. All ſix were almoſt equally eſteem'd by his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and moſt of them had their peculiar Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Tis obſerved that the <hi>Andrian,</hi> and the <hi>Brothers,</hi> excel in their <hi>Characters</hi> and <hi>Manners;</hi> the <hi>Eunuch</hi> and <hi>Phormio,</hi> in the Vigor and Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of their <hi>Intrigues;</hi> and the <hi>Self-tormentor,</hi> and <hi>Mother-in-Law,</hi> in their <hi>Thoughts, Paſſions,</hi> and Purity of <hi>Stile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the account of his intimate Acquaintance with <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Lelius,</hi> it was, and is ſtill gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally believed that they had a great, if not a principal Share, in the making of his Plays: And this Conjecture is grounded not only upon the extraordinary Familiarity between them; but alſo
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:180391:17"/> the <hi>Accuracy, Propriety, Purity</hi> and <hi>Politeneſs</hi> of the <hi>Stile,</hi> which do indeed ſeem above a poor <hi>Africans</hi> Abilities. But theſe are but meer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, intermixed with a Spice of Malice; tho indeed redounding much to his Honour, as he himſelf intimates in the Prologue to his <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> The extraordinary Familiarity between them, was probably cauſed by his Eminent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts. The <hi>Accuracy</hi> and <hi>Propriety</hi> of his <hi>Style,</hi> proceeded, perhaps, from his Labour and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; as the <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Politeneſs</hi> of it, might be the Effects of his <hi>Roman</hi> Education, and his keeping the beſt Company. And if he defended himſelf but ſlightly whene're he was accuſed; that may be reckon'd his great Complaiſance to thoſe Noble Perſons.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Crimes he was often charged with; but in the Thirty Fifth Year of his Age, either to avoid theſe Scandals, or to inſtruct himſelf in the Cuſtoms and Manners of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> he left <hi>Rome</hi> to go for that Country, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is ſaid by ſeveral, that he died very poor; but however his Daughter (the only Child he left) after his deceaſe was marryed to a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight; to whom he left a Houſe and a Garden of Six Acres, which was ſituated under the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian-Way,</hi> nigh that place called <hi>Villa-Martis.</hi>

                        <p>For Loves ſake, dear Hearts! hear me out— Not long after my Mother died at <hi>Rhodes;</hi> now my Uncle, you muſt know, was a little given to the World, and perceiving the Girl was very likely, and had a good hand at the Lute, hoped to make Money of her, and forthwith expoſed her to Sale, and made his Markets on her. As good Luck wou'd have it, my Friend the Captain being there, buys her for a Preſent for me, being perfectly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this whole Affair. He's juſt come to Town, and perceiving what's between you and I, he invents many Excuſes and Flams to put off his parting with her as long as he can: But ſays, cou'd he but perſwade himſelf I lov'd him better than you, and were he not miſerably afraid that when I once got her I ſhou'd turn him off, he'd part with her preſently. This he's ſtill afraid of, but as far as I can perceive he has a hankering after her himſelf.</p>

I was every day taunting at him: <hi>How now,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>De'e think to go on after this vile rate? And keep a Miſtreſs ſo openly, whilſt I am living? No</hi> Clinie, <hi>you're mightily miſtaken, and don't know me, if you think ſo; I ſhall look upon ye as mine, as long as ye do what ye ought to do; but if otherwiſe, I know what I ought to do, and you ſhall find it. I know this is only the effects of too much Idleneſs; when I was at your Years I didn't give my Mind to Women; but was forced to go a Souldier into</hi> Aſia <hi>to get a Livelihood; where by the War I got</hi>

                           <hi>me both Riches and Honour too.</hi> At laſt, Matters came to that paſs, that the poor Boy hearing the ſame thing preſs'd upon him ſo often, and ſo grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was brought over. And thinking my Age and Prudence better Guides than his own, he ſhipp'd off for <hi>Aſia,</hi> and went Reformade under the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> there, Mr. <hi>Chremes.</hi>—</p>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:180391:88"/> don't admire that all the Sparks of the Town ſhou'd die for ye, ſince your Diſcourſe diſcovers the Sweetneſs of your diſpoſition: For my part, when I come to conſider the Life and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all ſuch as you, who are n't common to every Coxcomb, I don't wonder to find ye ſo modeſt and vertuous, and our ſelves ſo very little like ye. For you it is the beſt way to be honeſt, but our Gallants won't ſuffer us to be ſo. Our Beauty makes 'em adore us for a while, but when that's decay'd, the Sparks are mad for a new Face: So that if we didn't provide for our ſelves in time, we might een pine away the reſt of our days in a Deſart. For you Madam, that take up with a Perſon, whoſe Age and Nature is correſpondent with your own, he wholly keeps himſelf to you, and by mutual conſent your Loves are made firm; and nothing can ever ſeparate your Hearts.</p>

                        <p>Patience, good Brother! Prithee don't deafen my Ears with old Stories. You gave me your Son, and by Adoption he's mine; if he be extravagant, I ſhall bear the blame on't, and pay for't over and above. He treats, he drinks, he dreſſes! 'Tis all at my Charge. He keeps a Miſs too! I'll ſupply his Pocket as long as I'm able, and when that fails, perhaps they'll turn him out. Has he broke any Doors? They ſhall be made good. Torn any Cloaths? They ſhall be mended too. I thank my Stars I've where-withal to do it, and as yet not uneaſie under it. In ſhort! Either leave off complaining, or chooſe who you will be judg'd by: and I'll make't appear, that you're more to blame than I.</p>

But when that was done, tell me, did you take the leaſt care about it? Or did you forecaſt in ſuch a caſe what ſhould ha' been done? Or how it ſhould ha' been done? And if thou hadſt been aſham'd to tell it me, cou'dn't I ha' know on't by others? In this you were in doubt of for ten Months together: So you have betray'd your ſelf, the poor young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and your own Child too, as much as you were able. What? D'ye think that the God's ſhou'd do your work for ye, and you ſleep the while? Muſt ſhe be brought to your Bed-ſide, as if ſhe were not worth the fetching? I wou dn't ha' thee ſo miſerably careleſs in other things for the World.— Come don't be caſt down however, thou ſhalt marry her.</p>

A Stranger, that wou'd be my Son-in-Law, wou'd hold his Tongue, as long as we were good Friends together; but if he once diſregarded me,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:180391:152"/> he'll know more by half than I'd have him.

                        <p>Let my own Concerns go as they will, yet 'tis a Comfort to me that Matters go ſo well with my Couſin. 'Tis a piece of Art for a Man to rule his Appetite ſo, that a ſmall Matter ſhall ſatisfie him when his Fortune is at the loweſt Ebb. No ſooner had my Couſin <hi>Phedrie</hi> receiv'd the Money, but his Cares are over, for my part I know no way to free my ſelf from mine. If this buſineſs be conceal'd, I ſhall be always in fear; if diſcover'd Infamy will be my reward.— I cou'dn't ha' the Heart to go home, if I hadn't ſome-ſmall hopes of enjoying my dear <hi>Phanie</hi> ſtill.— But where ſhall I meet with <hi>Geta.</hi> to know of him what may be the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time of ſhewing my ſelf to my Father?</p>

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:180391:174"/> Houſe half diſtracted.— For when I haſtily went in juſt now, in great concern for my Wife (think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to find her ſick of another-gates Diſtemper than what, alas! I found her in:) The Maids being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at firſt ſight all of 'em o're-joyd, cry'd out, <hi>Hes come:</hi> But immediately after I perceived they changed Countenance, becauſe I happen'd to come at ſuch an unlucky Minute: mean time one of 'em ran up Stairs to give notice of my Arrival; and I, as eager to ſee my Wife, follow her directly. No ſooner was I got in, but immediately I perceiv'd her Ailment, unhappy Creature as I was: For they had no time i'th World to conceal the buſineſs, for her Cryings out did ſufficiently diſcover her Condition. When I ſaw this, <hi>Baſe and unworthy,</hi> ſaid I! And with that immediately flung out of the Room all in Tears, ſtruck with Horror at ſuch an unheard of diſmal Accident. Her Mother, poor Soul, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me cloſe, catch'd me at the Door, and flung her ſelf at my Feet, melting into Tears: ſo that I cou'd not but pity her: And truly, I'm of Opinion, as a Man's Fortune riſes or falls ſo is he up or down. She thus addreſs'd her ſelf to me: <hi>My dear</hi> Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus, <hi>you're an Eye-witneſs now of the Cauſe that made this unhappy Creature leave your Houſe: She was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd ſometime ſince by an unknown Villain; and is now fled hither to hide her ſhame from you and the World. <stage>He wipes his Eyes.</stage>
                           </hi> But alas! the very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of her earneſt Intreaties makes me melt afreſh.— <hi>Whatſoever Chance or Fortune</hi> (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu d ſhe) <hi>has brought you hither at this juncture, by that we both conjure ye (if we may in Equity and Juſtice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume ſo far) to bury and conceal this Miſchance from the Eye of the World. If ever (dear</hi> Pamphilus!) <hi>if ever you were ſenſible that ſhe had any Tenderneſs for ye, in requital ſhe begs ye not to think that ſmall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour too much to grant her. As for taking her again,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:180391:174"/> uſe your own diſcretion.
